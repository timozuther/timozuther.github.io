        <p>This website is hosted externally. The personal data collected on this website are stored on the host’s
            servers. This includes IP addresses, contact requests, meta and communication data, contract data, contact
            details, names, website access, and other data generated by a website.</p>
        <p>External hosting is carried out for the purpose of fulfilling contracts with our potential and existing
            customers (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) and in the interest of a secure, fast, and efficient provision of our online
            services by a professional provider (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). If a corresponding consent was requested, the
            processing is based exclusively on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the
            storage of cookies or access to information on the user's device (e.g., device fingerprinting). The consent
            can be revoked at any time.</p>

        <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Disclosures</h2>
        <h3>Data Protection</h3>
        <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal
            data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy
            policy.</p>
        <p>When you use this website, various personal data will be collected. Personal data refers to data that can
            personally identify you. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also
            explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
        <p>We point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication by email) can have security gaps.
            Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
        <h3>Contact Information</h3>
        <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
        <p>Timo Zuther<br />Auf dem Wasen 3<br />81825 Munich<br />Germany</p>
        <p>Email: 360productionsandroid@gmail.com</p>
        <p>Phone: +49 89 80929716</p>
        <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes
            and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
        <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
        <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will
            remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for
            deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally
            permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods under tax or commercial law); in
            the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons no longer apply.</p>

        <h3>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website</h3>
        <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or
            Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9(1) GDPR. In the case of
            explicit consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on
            Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device
            (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25(1) TTDSG. The consent
            can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the performance of a contract or for
            pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process
            your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. The data processing
            can also be based on our legitimate interest under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal
            basis for each individual case is provided in the following sections of this privacy policy.</p>

        <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
        <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This may also involve the
            transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only share personal data with external parties if
            this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., sharing
            data with tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer as per Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if
            another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using processors, we only transfer personal data of our
            customers based on a valid processing contract. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint
            processing is concluded.</p>

        <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
        <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke any previously
            given consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains
            unaffected by the revocation.</p>

        <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Specific Cases and to Direct Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
        <p>IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE
            PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
            PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH THE PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE
            FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE
            CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND
            FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING
            TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
        <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO
            THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO
            THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE
            USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>

        <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
        <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
            authority, particularly in the Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of the
            alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to any other administrative or
            judicial remedies.</p>

        <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>You have the right to receive the data we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a
            contract in a commonly used, machine-readable format, or to have it transferred to a third party. If you
            request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done if technically
            feasible.</p>

        <h3>Right to Access, Rectification, and Erasure</h3>
        <p>Within the scope of applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to request free information
            about your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose of data processing, and, if
            applicable, a right to have this data corrected or erased. For this, as well as for further questions on the
            topic of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>

        <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
        <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at
            any time regarding this. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this.
                For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
                your personal data.</li>
            <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data
                processing instead of erasure.</li>
            <li>If we no longer need your personal data but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you
                have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.
            </li>
            <li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of your and our interests must
                be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to
                request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from being stored – may only
            be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the
            protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of
            the European Union or a Member State.</p>
        <h2>4. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>Our website uses so-called "cookies." Cookies are small data packets and do not cause any harm to your
            device. They are either temporarily stored for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently
            (permanent cookies) on your device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit ends.
            Permanent cookies remain on your device until you delete them yourself or until they are automatically
            deleted by your web browser.</p>
        <p>Cookies may come from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies).
            Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services from third-party companies within websites
            (e.g., cookies for handling payment services).</p>
        <p>Cookies serve different purposes. Many cookies are technically necessary, as certain website functions would
            not work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or displaying videos). Other cookies may be used to
            analyze user behavior or for advertising purposes.</p>
        <p>Cookies that are necessary to carry out the electronic communication process, to provide certain functions
            you desire (e.g., for the shopping cart function), or to optimize the website (e.g., cookies to measure web
            audiences) are stored based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website
            operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies to ensure a technically error-free and
            optimized provision of their services. If consent for the storage of cookies and comparable recognition
            technologies was requested, processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of this consent (Art. 6(1)(a)
            GDPR and § 25(1) TTDSG); consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
        <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and to allow cookies only in
            individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or in general, and activate the
            automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of
            this website may be restricted.</p>
        <p>You can find out which cookies and services are used on this website in this privacy policy.</p>

        <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
        <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which
            your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
            <li>Operating system used</li>
            <li>Referrer URL</li>
            <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
            <li>Time of the server request</li>
            <li>IP address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p>
        <p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in
            the technically error-free presentation and optimization of their website – for this, the server log files
            must be recorded.</p>

        <h3>Contact Form</h3>
        <p>If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact
            details you provide there, will be stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of
            follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.</p>
        <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request is related to the performance of a
            contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
            processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries addressed to us (Art.
            6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this was requested; consent can be revoked at any
            time.</p>
        <p>The data you provide in the contact form will remain with us until you request its deletion, revoke your
            consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your inquiry has been
            processed). Mandatory legal provisions – especially retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>

        <h3>Inquiry by Email, Phone, or Fax</h3>
        <p>If you contact us by email, phone, or fax, your inquiry, including all personal data resulting from it (name,
            inquiry), will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your request. We do not pass on
            this data without your consent.</p>
        <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your request is related to the performance of a
            contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
            processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries addressed to us (Art.
            6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this was requested; consent can be revoked at any
            time.</p>
        <p>The data you send to us via contact inquiries will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your
            consent to storage, or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been
            processed). Mandatory legal provisions – especially statutory retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>
        <h2>5. Newsletter</h2>
        <h3>Newsletter Data</h3>
        <p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we need an email address from you, along
            with information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the provided email address and that you
            agree to receive the newsletter. No further data will be collected, or only on a voluntary basis. We use
            this data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
        <p>The processing of the data entered in the newsletter registration form is based solely on your consent (Art.
            6(1)(a) GDPR). You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the email address, and its use for
            sending the newsletter at any time, for example, via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality
            of the data processing already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
        <p>The data you provide for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter
            service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and will be deleted from the newsletter
            distribution list after you unsubscribe. We reserve the right to delete or block email addresses from our
            newsletter distribution list at our discretion within the framework of our legitimate interest according to
            Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
        <p>Data stored by us for other purposes remain unaffected by this.</p>
        <p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored in a blacklist
            by us or the newsletter service provider, if necessary, to prevent future mailings. The data from the
            blacklist will only be used for this purpose and not combined with other data. This serves both your
            interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements for the sending of newsletters (legitimate
            interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite. <strong>You may object
                to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong></p>

        <h3>Newsletter for Existing Customers</h3>
        <p>If you order goods or services from us and provide your email address, we may subsequently use this email
            address to send you newsletters. In such a case, the newsletter will only contain direct advertising for
            similar goods or services of our own. You can unsubscribe from this newsletter at any time. To do so, there
            is a corresponding link in each newsletter. The legal basis for sending the newsletter is Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR
            in conjunction with § 7(3) UWG.</p>
        <p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored in a blacklist
            to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose and not combined
            with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with legal requirements for
            the sending of newsletters (legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). The storage in the
            blacklist is indefinite. You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.

        <h3>Firebase</h3>
        <p>We use Firebase, among other things, as a web hosting and cloud service on our website. The service provider
            is the American company Google Inc. For the European region, the company responsible for all Google services
            is Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland).</p>
        <p>Google also processes your data in the USA. Google is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy
            Framework, which regulates the proper and secure transfer of personal data from EU citizens to the USA. You

        <p>Additionally, Google uses so-called standard contractual clauses (SCC) (= Art. 46(2) and (3) GDPR). Standard
            contractual clauses are templates provided by the EU Commission and are intended to ensure that your data
            also complies with European data protection standards when transferred to third countries (such as the USA).
            Through the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and the standard contractual clauses, Google undertakes to comply
            with European data protection levels when processing your relevant data, even if the data is stored,
            processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing decision of the EU Commission.
            You can find the decision and the corresponding standard contractual clauses here: <a
